                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <img src="web.jpeg" alt="Image 1">
                <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of frontend development (user interface) and backend development (server-side logic and databases). Modern web development often involves frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue for enhanced functionality. Responsive design ensures websites adapt to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience. With continuous advancements, web development is evolving to include AI-driven features, progressive web apps, and enhanced security measures.</p>

                <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                <img src="ml.jpeg" alt="Image 2">
                <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques. Popular libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn are used to build models for tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. Machine learning is widely applied in healthcare, finance, and recommendation systems. As data grows, advancements in deep learning and neural networks are pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities.</p>

                <h3>Blockchain</h3>
                <img src="blockchain.jpeg" alt="Image 3">
                <p>Blockchain development involves designing and building decentralized applications (dApps) using blockchain technology. It ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions through distributed ledger systems. Popular blockchain platforms include Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Solana, enabling smart contract functionality. Industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management leverage blockchain for enhanced security and trust. With continuous advancements, blockchain is shaping the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 applications.</p>
